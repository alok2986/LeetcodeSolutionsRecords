Hint
Design an algorithm that accepts a stream of integers and retrieves the product of the last k integers of the stream.

Implement the ProductOfNumbers class:

ProductOfNumbers() Initializes the object with an empty stream.
void add(int num) Appends the integer num to the stream.
int getProduct(int k) Returns the product of the last k numbers in the current list. You can assume that always the current list has at least k numbers.
The test cases are generated so that, at any time, the product of any contiguous sequence of numbers will fit into a single 32-bit integer without overflowing.

 

Example:

Input
["ProductOfNumbers","add","add","add","add","add","getProduct","getProduct","getProduct","add","getProduct"]
[[],[3],[0],[2],[5],[4],[2],[3],[4],[8],[2]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,null,null,20,40,0,null,32]

Explanation
ProductOfNumbers productOfNumbers = new ProductOfNumbers();
productOfNumbers.add(3);        // [3]
productOfNumbers.add(0);        // [3,0]
productOfNumbers.add(2);        // [3,0,2]
productOfNumbers.add(5);        // [3,0,2,5]
productOfNumbers.add(4);        // [3,0,2,5,4]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 20. The product of the last 2 numbers is 5 * 4 = 20
productOfNumbers.getProduct(3); // return 40. The product of the last 3 numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40
productOfNumbers.getProduct(4); // return 0. The product of the last 4 numbers is 0 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 0
productOfNumbers.add(8);        // [3,0,2,5,4,8]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 32. The product of the last 2 numbers is 4 * 8 = 32 

Solution:
class ProductOfNumbers {
  public ProductOfNumbers() {
    prefix = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1));
  }

  public void add(int num) {
    if (num == 0)
      prefix = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1));
    else
      prefix.add(prefix.get(prefix.size() - 1) * num);
  }

  public int getProduct(int k) {
    return k >= prefix.size() ? 0
                              : prefix.get(prefix.size() - 1) / prefix.get(prefix.size() - k - 1);
  }

  private List<Integer> prefix = new ArrayList<>();
}

1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
Solved

Hint
Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:

The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.

A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 20
